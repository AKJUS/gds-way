# GDS tech

This repository documents some of the technical decisions that the
Government Digital Service has made for the products we operate.

It complements the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) which
covers service design more broadly.

If you think that you can contribute a change to this repository which reflects
current practice at GDS, make a pull request to this repo and we'll discuss it
at the Tech Ops Forum meeting and in the
[#tech-ops-forum Slack channel](https://govuk.slack.com/messages/tech-ops-forum/).

Products at GDS must follow the
[discovery, alpha, beta and live phases set out in the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery).
Products at discovery and alpha can optionally follow the recommendations
in this repository. Projects at beta and live should follow these recommendations.
