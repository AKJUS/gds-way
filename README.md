# GDS tech

This repository documents some of the technical decisions that the
Government Digital Service has made for the products we operate.

It complements the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) which
covers service design more broadly.

Right now we won't accept pull requests that change the decisions in this
repository. Ask about changes in the
[#tech-ops-forum Slack channel](https://govuk.slack.com/messages/tech-ops-forum/).
