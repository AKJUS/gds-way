To make services available on the internet they need to have DNS records to let people know where they are.
service.gov.uk domains are delegated to [nameservers](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name#check-where-youll-host-your-dns) controlled by service teams.


## Principles

- DNS entry configuration should come from a version-controlled repository unless autogenerated
- consider nameserver availability as part of your overall service availability


## Recommendations

- use route53 from AWS
- if you want more availabilty for your nameservers use Google and/or Dyn
- use a tool such as [govuk-dns](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-dns) or [octodns](https://github.com/github/octodns) to version control and publish your records if you need to
