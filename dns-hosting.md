To make services available on the internet they need to have DNS records to let people know where they are.
service.gov.uk domains are delegated to [nameservers](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name#check-where-youll-host-your-dns) controlled by service teams.


## Principles

- DNS entries should be version controlled unless autogenerated
- Nameservers should be sufficiently redundant for your service requirements


## Recommendations

- use route53 from AWS
- if you need more redundancy also use Google and/or DYN
- use [govuk-dns](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-dns) to version control and publish your records if you need to
