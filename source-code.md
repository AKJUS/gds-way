We follow the principles set out in the service manual for
managing the code that we write:

- [use version control](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/maintaining-version-control-in-coding)
- [make source code open](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)

You should keep secrets separate from source code.

GDS uses GitHub.

## GitHub

New repositories for GDS products and services go in the
[alphagov](https://github.com/alphagov/) organisation on GitHub.

If the repository contains secrets rather than code,
make it private and restrict the people who have access to it.
Consider encrypting the contents of the repository.

Teams are responsible for ensuring that their Git repositories
are backed up to another location.
