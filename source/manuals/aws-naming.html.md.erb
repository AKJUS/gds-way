# <%= current_page.data.title %>

We use [AWS for hosting](../standards/hosting.html).
 
An agreed naming convention helps us to understand our environment better and the function of various resources running across the estate at a quick glance. 

## Importance 
A defined naming convention with defined values gives us greater ability to automate at scale making management and administration easier. 
A defined naming convention with fixed character lengths also improves our ability to easily define security monitoring use cases thereby making monitoring and response proactive.

## Convention

1. `Directorate/Programme`: This refers to the directorate and or programme to which the resource relates to. Abbreviations will be used to identify ones that exist

2. `Environment`: This refers to the environment or deployment stage of the resource, such as "dev" for development, "stg" for staging, or "prod" for production.

3. `Region`: This represents the geographic region where the resource is deployed, such as "us-west-1" for the western United States, "eu-central-1" for central Europe, or "ap-southeast-1" for Southeast Asia.

4. `Resource`: This denotes the type of resource being named, such as "app" for an application, "db" for a database, or "lb" for a load balancer.  Abbreviations will be used to identify various resource types

5. `Application/Function/Service`: This specifies the function or purpose of the resource. It could also depict the application or service name such as "publisher" , “router”, “signon”.

6. `InstanceID`: This is a unique identifier for the specific instance of the resource. A 2 digit numerical value will be used.

### Example

Putting it all together, here's an example of a resource name using this convention [Directorate]-[Environment]-[Region]-[Resource]-[Function]-[InstanceID]

govuk-prod-eu-west-1-eks-signon-01

This name indicates that it is a GOVUK production environment resource deployed in the EU West region. It is a container on an EKS cluster for the signon application, and it is the first instance of this resource.
