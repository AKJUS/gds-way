title: Writing Python at GDS

# <%= current_page.data.title %>


### About this manual

This manual is designed to aid developers in writing Python code that is clear and consistent, within, and across,
projects at GDS.


### Guidance

We follow [PEP8][], in some cases [PEP8][] doesn't express a view (e.g. on the usage of language
features such as metaclasses) in these cases we defer to the [Google Python style guide][GPSG].
We suggest using [PEP8][] and the [Google Python style guide][GPSG] (in order of preference) as references unless
something is explicitly mentioned in the [GDS Python Style Guide][GDSPSG].


### Additional rules

The [GDS Python Style Guide][GDSPSG] is the place for detailing GDS specific rules/ exemptions to [PEP8][] or the
[Google Python style guide][GPSG]. An example of which is allowing a line length of 120 instead of 79.

As always the rules in the [GDS Python Style Guide][GDSPSG] should be followed only in conjunction with the advice
on consistency on the main [programming languages manual page][GDSPSG].

If you want to add a new rule or exception please create a pull request against this repo.


### Linting

_For more on linting (including standard settings and config) see the [linting][linting] section of this manual._

[Flake8][] is the preferred linting tool. It incorporates:

* [PEP-0008][PEP8] inspired style checks using PyCodeStyle
* [Complexity][WikiCyclomatic_complexity] checking using the [McCabe project][McCabe]
* Lint checks using [PyFlakes][]


### Updating this manual

This manual, and by extension the [GDS Python Style Guide][GDSPSG], is not presumed to be infallible or beyond dispute.
If you think something is missing or if you'd like to see something changed then:

1. _(optional)_ Start with the [#python][slack-python] Slack channel. See what other developers think and you'll get an idea
of how likely your proposal is of being accepted as a pull request even before you put in any work.
2. Check out the making changes section of the [GDS Way repo][github-gds-way-readme-making-changes]
3. Create a pull request against [GDS Way repo][github-gds-way]
