We use Kotlin for Android development at GDS because it's the recommended language for building Android apps (see [Android's Kotlin-first approach]).

For use cases outside of mobile development, [Java] is still our default choice for the Java virtual machine (JVM).

As a result, this guide may lean towards Android-specific tools and conventions.
