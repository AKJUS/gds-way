[Git hooks](https://githooks.com/) are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. Pre-commit hooks are useful in secrets management because they check for errors and problems before developers commit work locally on their machines.

The Cyber Security team are working on a [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-pre-commit) for GDS to use. The main reason for using pre-commit hooks is to prevent secrets being pushed to GitHub repositories.
