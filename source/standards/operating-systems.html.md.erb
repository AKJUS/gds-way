When choosing an operating system (OS) for your Virtual Machine (VM) we recommend using [Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

You should apply security hardening to your VM (for example disable root ssh access and ssh access using password) and keep your OS:

- auto updated for security issues
- up to date with the latest OS releases
- able to run on a local virtual machine

If you need newer kernels or features than those in Ubuntu LTS you can use a standard Ubuntu release. If you use a standard Ubuntu release you should migrate to the latest version within 3 months to ensure it stays within its support period and receives security updates.
