This guidance makes recommendations for choosing an operating system for a Virtual Machine (VM).

We recommend you use [Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as an operating system for your VM. You should apply some security hardening, for example, disabling root ssh access using password.

You can use non-LTS Ubuntu if you need newer kernels/features. To ensure you receive all security updates you should migrate to the latest OS version within 3 months of release.

You should value stability when choosing operating systems for Virtual Machines by ensuring they're:

- auto updated for security issues
- kept up to date with the latest OS releases
- able to run as an OS on a local virtual machine

Following these recommendations will help GDS service teams:

- assist people moving teams without learning a new OS or distribution
- know they are using a secure and maintained OS
