You should use [Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) as an operating system (OS) for your virtual machine (VM).

You must apply hardening to your VM. For example, you should only use SSH keys _that are protected by a passphrase_ to access VMs. You should disable root SSH access and SSH access using a password.

You must also make sure your OS is:

* automatically updated for security issues
* up to date with the latest OS releases
* able to run on a local VM

GDS recommends LTS as the default choice for your VM. If you are running the latest LTS release and there are newer features not available in that release, for instance newer kernels, consider using the official backports or trustworthy PPA sources rather than upgrading the whole OS to a standard (non-LTS) release. Care must be taken to ensure that these backports and other sources receive regular and timely security updates but this should be less burden than having to continually (every 6-9 months) update the OS on VMs.

If you do use standard Ubuntu, it is essential to migrate to the latest release within 3 months to ensure you stay within the support period and receive security updates. This must be considered carefully when proposing adopting standard Ubuntu releases as it can affect the stability of your running service. Standard releases only receive security updates for 9 months after their initial release whereas LTS receives support for 5 years (or longer with paid-for extended support).
