We follow the principles set out in the service manual for
managing the code that we write:

- [use version control](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/maintaining-version-control-in-coding)
- [make source code open](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)

You should keep secrets separate from source code.

GDS uses GitHub.

## GitHub

New repositories for GDS products and services go in the
[alphagov](https://github.com/alphagov/) organisation on GitHub.

You can use your personal GitHub account at GDS. Ask your tech
lead or technical architect to add you to the organisation.

If the repository contains secrets rather than code,
make it private and restrict the people who have access to it.
Consider encrypting the contents of the repository.

Teams are responsible for ensuring that their Git repositories
are backed up to another location.

GitHub organisations should have two-factor authorisation enforced for all members using the GitHub organisation settings.

### Retired applications

If an application is no longer used in production its public repository should
be [archived](https://help.github.com/articles/archiving-repositories/).

The application's README should be updated to detail why the repository has
been archived, and should link to a new location if the function of the
application has been superseded.
