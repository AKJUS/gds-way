At GDS, we follow the principles set out in the Service Manual for managing the code we write by:

- [using version control](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/maintaining-version-control-in-coding)
- [making source code open](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)

You must [keep some data and code closed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed), including:

- keys and credentials
- algorithms used to detect fraud
- code or data that makes clear details of unannounced policy

## Use GitHub

[GDS uses GitHub as its code repository](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/31/how-we-use-git-at-the-government-digital-service/).

Put new repositories for GDS services in the [alphagov](https://github.com/alphagov/) organisation on GitHub.

You can use your personal GitHub account to access alphagov. Ask your tech lead or technical architect to invite you. GDS will revoke your access to alphagov when you leave GDS.

To secure your Github repository, make sure you:

- configure two-factor authentication for your account
- have considered encrypting your repository contents
- consider [protecting your master branch](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/) to prevent changes being committed without a suitable review

You can also consider backing up your Git repositories to another location (this should be a team responsibility).

### How to to retire applications

If an application is no longer used in production, you should [archive](https://help.github.com/articles/archiving-repositories/) its repository.

Update the application's README to explain why the repository has been archived, and link to a new location if the application has been superseded.
