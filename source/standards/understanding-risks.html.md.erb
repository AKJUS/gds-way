When you build, maintain or change your service, you must have a clear understanding of any associated risks because they will impact your service design and affect your users.

You should work with [GDS Information Assurance (IA)][] to design appropriate solutions for your service's risks. IA may need to obtain risk acceptance from your Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) in some cases, such as your service needing offshoring approval.

The Service Manual has some recommendations which can reduce risk to your service, for example, how to:

* [protect against fraud][] when you design and manage your service
* [secure your information][] if you handle ‘official’ classified data

## Model security threats

[Modelling threats][] can help you gain a clearer understanding of threats against your service. GDS uses [Attack Tree][] development workshops to model threats. Any workshops you run should cover all potential [attack vectors][].

The [Cyber Security team][] can provide guidance and help run an Attack Tree workshop.

## Further Reading

The [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)][] provides guidance about cyber security. The Service Manual has advice about [securing your information][] and [securing your cloud environment][].
