When you're building, maintaining, or changing a service you must do so with a clear understanding of the associated threats and risks as they should impact your design.

The service manual sets out the following principles for protecting services and information:

- [Protecting your service against fraud](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/protecting-your-service-against-fraud)
- [Securing your information](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/securing-your-information)

You should be continuously collaborating with the [GDS Information Assurance (IA) team](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/operations/information-assurance) to understand your service's risks and design appropriate mitigations. In some scenarios the IA team may need to obtain risk acceptance from your SIRO before you may proceed with certain activities.

## Modelling security threats

You can gain a clearer understanding of the threats to your service by [modelling them](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling).
At GDS, we typically do threat modelling by running [Attack Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_tree) development workshops. We recommend that these workshops involve a mixture of disciplines to help cover all vectors of attack.

If you're unsure about how to run an Attack Tree workshop the Cybersercurity team can provide guidance, attend the workshops, or facilitate them.
