When you build, maintain or change your service you must have a clear understanding of any associated threats and risks because they will impact your service design.

You should work with the [GDS Information Assurance (IA)][] team to understand your service’s risks and design appropriate solutions. IA may need to obtain risk acceptance from your Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO), for example if your service needs risk acceptance or offshoring approval.

The service manual has some recommendations about how you can:

* [protect against fraud][] when you design and manage your service
* [secure your information][] if you handle ‘official’ classified data

## Model security threats

Gain a clearer understanding of the threats to your service by [modelling them][]. GDS uses [Attack Tree][] development workshops to model threats. Any workshops you run should cover all vectors of an attack.

The Cyber Security team can provide guidance and help facilitate an Attack Tree workshop. Contact Cyber Security using the [#security Slack channel][] or by email using [security-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk][].

## Further Reading

The [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)][] provides guidance and intelligence about cybersecurity. The Service Manual has advice about [securing your information][] and [securing your cloud environment][].
