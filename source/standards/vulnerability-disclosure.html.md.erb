## Vulnerability Disclosure

In the Cabinet Office, including GDS, the [CDIO cyber security team] run a
vulnerability disclosure programme with HackerOne and a third party to triage
reports from security researchers.

This isn't a sign-post for security reseachers to 'hack' our systems but we want
to advocate secure disclosure so we can find out about issues and fix them
before they cause a security incident.

GOV.UK hosts the security policy:
<https://www.gov.uk/help/report-vulnerability>

## security.txt
A `security.txt` file is a way of telling researchers how to get in contact with
us. As per the current policy, we only accept reports from services that have a
`security.txt` file pointing the [security policy].

The file should be hosted at `https://{domain}/.well-known/security.txt`, use a
`text/plain` content type and follow the [current security.txt guidance].

We have a central deployment of the `security.txt` file so that we only have to
keep one place up-to-date. The public [alphagov/security.txt] repo is where
it's maintained.

You should use <https://vdp.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/.well-known/security.txt>
in either:

- the origin for your site's `/.well-known/security.txt`
- destination of 302 redirect for `/.well-known/security.txt`

You may also do either (but only in addition to the `/.well-known/security.txt`
endpoint) for `/security.txt`.
