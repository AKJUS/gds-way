When designing your services you may need to use a data store, for example to collect and store data, such as user details, from your app.

Read [the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology) for more information about choosing technology, development, integration, hosting, testing, security and maintenance.

## Types of data store

There are 2 distinct classes of data store implementation, known as managed and unmanaged.

### Managed

Follow GDS Reliability Engineering principles and [use fully managed cloud services by default](https://reliability-engineering.cloudapps.digital/documentation/strategy-and-principles/re-principles.html#3-use-fully-managed-cloud-services-by-default).

Managed services are easier to put in place than unmanaged because they’re usually offered as a service. This means you do not need to manage the underlying data store technology.

Managed services handle complicated aspects of data stores for you like:

- replication and backups
- operating system updates
- update and patches to the data store software

### Unmanaged

With an unmanaged service, it’s your responsibility to install and manage the:

- data store software
- underlying or associated technologies

Use an unmanaged data store if a managed service would be more complicated to put in place and maintain. For example, with an unmanaged service you could store all aspects of the data store using real or virtual machines which you’ll need to manage.
