At GDS we follow the Service Manual, [making source code open and reusable][].

Our open source projects are developed for use on GOV.UK and other work we do, such as [Puppet module for go-audit][] or the [GDS Operations open source web site][]. Unless stated otherwise, all our open source software is released under the [MIT licence][] and is free to use. We encourage and appreciate contributions.

Releasing your project as open source software can benefit other government departments and outside institutions.

When you publish open source code, your project must:

* include a readme
* have useful and informative commit messages about why a change was made
* provide a changelog, for example the [specification for CPAN Changes files][]
* include a valid open source licence file
* link to a public list of known issues and bugs
* have an email address to submit security related bug reports
* list a version number compatible with [Semantic Versioning][]

Your open source code project should:

* publish packages to relevant language specific repositories such as [PyPI - the Python Package Index][] or [RubyGems][]
* post contributors' guidelines in a contributing file
* set up any tests to run in a public continuous integration environment using tools such as [Travis CI][], [CircleCI][] or [Jenkins][]

Your project could also include a contributors file, like the [Go repository][]. You can also provide a mailing list so people can discuss your project.
