Read this guide when you need to name an application for your service. Your users should understand what a given application does from its name.

## Your application name should be self-descriptive

Avoid naming applications using puns or branding, as this makes it difficult for others to understand what the application does.

Ensure you use the same name consistently whenever you’re referring to the same application. In most cases the name of an application’s GitHub repository, for example [alphagov/signon](
https://github.com/alphagov/signon) should match its application name.

For example, these application names clearly communicate their purpose:

- [Signon](https://signon.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in) (which used to be called signonontron2000)
- [Manuals Publisher](https://github.com/alphagov/manuals-publisher)
- [Smart Answers](https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers)
- [Digital Marketplace Admin Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-admin-frontend)
- [Notifications PaaS Autoscaler](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-paas-autoscaler)

The names of these applications are ambiguous and possibly confusing:

- [Panopticon](https://github.com/gds-attic/panopticon)
- [Whitehall](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall)
- [Rummager](https://github.com/alphagov/rummager)
- [Maslow](https://github.com/alphagov/maslow)
- Magna Charta

The service manual has [good guidance for naming
services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service), much
of which will also be relevant when naming applications or packages.
