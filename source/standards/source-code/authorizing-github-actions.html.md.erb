# Authorizing GitHub Actions

We use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understanding-github-actions) to automate steps in our development and deployment workflows.

GitHub Actions need authorization in order to carry out their intended tasks. Choose the right approach for authorizing your GitHub Actions for your context.

## Using a GitHub App

Use a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/overview) to authenticate your GitHub Actions if they need to:

- undertake privileged tasks outside a single repository
- have persistent authentication
- use finer-grained permissions
- act as an integration rather than a user or workflow

There's more information about using GitHub Apps to run automated tasks in the [GitHub guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/deciding-when-to-build-a-github-app).

### Examples of when to use a GitHub App

- **Needing cross-repository or organization-wide automation**
  for example a bot that manages issues across multiple repositories in an organization.
- **Requiring fine-grained permissions**
  for example an integration that only needs read access to issues but write access to pull requests.
- **Building external integrations or services**
  for example a dashboard that aggregates PR status from multiple repos for reporting.
- **Acting on behalf of an integration, not a specific user or workflow**
  for example automatically enforcing code review policies across all repositories.
- **Needing persistent authentication outside of GitHub Actions**
  for example a scheduled job running on your own infrastructure that interacts with the GitHub API.

## Using the built in GITHUB_TOKEN

If your GitHub Action only needs to carry out tasks within a single repository, use the [GITHUB_TOKEN](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) for that repository.

For example, you can use the GITHUB_TOKEN to authorize a GitHub Action to:

- comment on issues
- create pull requests
- update workflow statuses in the same repository.

Read more about the [permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN in the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/github_token-reference#permissions-for-the-github_token)

### Examples of when to use the GITHUB_TOKEN

- **Automating tasks within a GitHub Actions workflow**
  for example automatically labeling issues or PRs in the same repository during a workflow run.
- **Posting workflow status checks**
  for example updating commit status or posting a check run result from a CI job.
- **Creating or updating issues/PRs in the same repository**
  for example creating a release note issue after a successful deployment.
- **Managing workflow artifacts**
  for example uploading or downloading build artifacts in a workflow.

<%= warning_text('Do not use Personal Access Tokens to authorize GitHub Actions') %>

Personal Access Tokens:

- rely on an individual person's GitHub account, causing Githhub Actions to break when people move teams, leave the programme, or the token expires
- are intended for individual use, and can't be centrally managed and audited

Only use PATs to authorize calls to the GitHub API you're making yourself as part of development.

## Configuring a GitHub App

Follow the guidance here to set up a GitHub App in your developer account:

- [About creating GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps)

You will need to provide your App permissions to access GitHub resources. Ensure the app only has the permissions it needs.

### Storing your Secrets Safely

Store the `client_id`, `client_secret` and `private_key` for this application safely.
The `client_secret` and `private_key` are sensitive and must be [stored in a secrets manager](/standards/storing-credentials.html). Choose from one of the following recommended approaches, depending on the scope of your app:

| App Scope                             | Recommendation                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single Repository                     | Local Repository Secret                                          |
| Multi-Repository (i.e. a Team or Pod) | Organisation Secret Value or AWS Secrets Manager (Build account) |
| Organisation-Wide                     | Organisation Secret Value                                        |

### Rotating your GitHub App's Secrets

You should include your GitHub App's secrets in your periodic [secrets audit](/standards/secrets-auditing.html).

Private keys do not expire and must be manually revoked. For more information about how to revoke or delete a private key, see [Deleting private keys](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps#deleting-private-keys).

### Naming Convention

To allow the use of Shared GitHub Actions and tooling, use the following naming convention for secrets:

- `GH_APP_{APP_NAME_ABBREVIATION}_CLIENT_ID`
- `GH_APP_{APP_NAME_ABBREVIATION}_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GH_APP_{APP_NAME_ABBREVIATION}_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `GH_APP_{APP_NAME_ABBREVIATION}_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` - if required to encode in base64

## Installing your App

Once configured, you can request that the app is [installed](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-your-own-github-app) in the organisation.

You can also request a transfer from your personal account to the organisation. To do this, once the App is production ready, change the ownership of the App to the
GitHub organisation by visiting `Settings -> Developer Settings -> GitHub Apps -> <your app> -> Advanced -> Transfer`

You will need a GitHub Org Admin to approve either of these installation approaches.

## Using your App

### GitHub Actions

If you are using the App in a GitHub Workflow, GitHub publishes a [common github action](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) which allows you to generate a new short-lived access token for your app, to undertake GitHub API requests.  This should be your first port of call before implementing anything custom.

### Scripting / External Implementations
To enable the App to make REST API requests you will need to use the App ID and Private key to generate a Json Web Token (JWT), then use the JWT to generate a Token.  Once you have the token you can make the request.

The lifetime of the JWT/Token is limited. Create them in a workflow. See an
[example workflow](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/team-manual/blob/main/.github/actions/make-jwt-for-gh/action.yaml) which expects
an App Client ID and Private Key to be provided.

See the GitHub documentation for further guidance:

- [generate a JWT](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-json-web-token-jwt-for-a-github-app)
- [generate a token](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [make a REST API request](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/making-authenticated-api-requests-with-a-github-app-in-a-github-actions-workflow)
