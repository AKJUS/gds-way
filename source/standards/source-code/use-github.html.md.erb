GDS uses [GitHub] to collaborate on code.
We have a number of GitHub organisations covering different parts of GDS, including:

| Organisation                                                         | Description                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [GDS AlphaGov](https://github.com/alphagov)                          | Used by most teams in the GDS Product Group, including GOV.UK and the Products and Services directorate. |
| [Central Digital and Data Office](https://github.com/co-cddo)        | Used by the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and other teams that used to be part of CDDO.  |

| [GOV.UK Digital Backbone](https://github.com/govuk-digital-backbone) | Used for the Digital Backbone (DBB) initiative which is part of OCTO.                                    |
| [GOV.UK One Login](https://github.com/govuk-one-login)               | Used by the Digital Identity directorate.                                                                |

## Common rules of access

You can use your personal GitHub account to access our GDS GitHub organisations.

All GitHub user accounts *must* be [connected][github-work-emails-for-github] with a valid `digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` email address.
You can also connect your `dsit.gov.uk` address if you like.

All `alphagov` not connected to a valid email address will be removed from the organisation.
Each organisation under the wider GDS Product Group Enterprise must enable similar processes for their area of responsibility.

You must also set up two-factor authentication on your account.

### Getting access to `alphagov`

To join `alphagov` ask your tech lead or technical architect to invite you.
Access is generally open for any technologist working within GDS.

### Getting access to `govuk-one-login`

Details about how to obtain access can be found on the üîê [GOV.UK One Login Team manual][gds-govuk-one-login-access] (GDS SSO required).
Access to `govuk-one-login` is generally limited to those working on the program or associated products (App, Wallet etc).

## Configuring GitHub repositories

Consider [protecting your main branch][github-protect-main] to prevent changes being committed without a suitable review.

You can also consider backing up your Git repositories to another location (this should be a team responsibility). If you are using AWS to host your service
[AWS CodeCommit][aws-code-commit] is one option.

### Using Github Actions and workflows

See [Using GitHub Actions and workflows][gds-use-of-gh-actions]

## How to retire applications

If an application is no longer used in production, you should [archive its repositories][github-archive-a-repo].

Update the application's README to explain why the repository has been archived, and link to a new location if the application has been superseded.


## Access GitHub support

The alphagov organisation is covered under the Cabinet Office's [GitHub enterprise support agreement][]. Under this agreement GitHub will respond to support requests within eight hours, Monday to Friday.

To access enterprise support you need either to be an enterprise admin or have been granted a support entitlement by an enterprise admin. There can only be a maximum of 20 people across the enterprise who have the support entitlement, so not everyone can have this.

#### Request support

If you are not already an enterprise admin or have a support entitlement on your GitHub user you will first need to ask one of the enterprise admins to be given permissons to access the support portal. You can do this by emailing the [GDS GitHub enterprise owners google group].

Once you've been given permission, you can view and raise support requests using GitHub's [support portal].

You should use your `@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` email during the sign up process to ensure your ticket is prioritised. You should also state that you are part of alphagov organisation in your request.
