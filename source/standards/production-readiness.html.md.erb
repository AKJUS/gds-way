Before taking your service into production and introducing it to live users make sure it meets the technical standards set by GDS and your team.

Some of these standards are in the GDS Way but your team may also have its own specific standards. For example, you may need to connect your service to [Logit][] before going to production.

You could have difficulties operating your service or supporting it when there’s a problem if you do not follow relevant standards like [alerting][] before people use your service.

## Use a checklist

To avoid problems when your service goes into production use a checklist to confirm if your service is ready. Each check should reference a standard that’s already in place before you can a service into production, like [documenting architecture decisions][].

Include communication checks to make sure specific groups or individuals are informed in advance, like senior management or user groups.

### Example checklist

To take a service into production, it must be possible to:

* search logs
* monitor its health
* view application metrics
* alert people when the service has problems
* follow a documented deployment process

You must also:

* have agreement to proceed from [Information Assurance (IA)][]
* inform PERSON A
* inform GROUP B
