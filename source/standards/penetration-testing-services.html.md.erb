You should aim to [penetration test](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/vulnerability-and-penetration-testing) your services at 6 month intervals.

Your team should work with the [GDS Information Assurance (IA)](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/operations/information-assurance) team to establish a testing schedule and to procure external tests.

Testing should be carried out by an approved third party through the [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) CHECK scheme](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/articles/check-fundamental-principles) or internally by a member of the GDS Cyber Security Team.

You may need to schedule additional testing following significant changes to your service. Regular meetings with Information Assurance to discuss ongoing changes can help identify these significant changes

Some examples of significant change are when you:

* change a cloud service provider
* make significant changes to your applicationâ€™s operation or code
* change stored data, for example if you introduce new data which can be classified as [PII (Personally Identifiable Information)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information)
* add a third-party partner, for example, a database processor or email provider (especially if the third-party partner is processing PII)

## How to scope your test

Before testing you should define:

* the beginning and end test dates
* the areas you want the tester to target, for example bypassing authentication
* what should be excluded, for example third party managed infrastructure
* the specific technical requirements to complete testing

## How to prepare for your test

Before you test you will be expected to share documentation with testers, for example up to date architecture diagrams. This can also include documentation for the individual components of each application being tested.

To prepare your test environment you should:

 * create temporary credentials for testers (testers should provide their own SSH public keys)
 * ensure your test environment is separate from your live environment
 * ensure your test environment replicates the live service
 * notify your service providers in advance, for example by [completing the AWS Penetration Testing request form](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/) or [emailing GOV.UK PaaS Support](gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

## What to do after testing

After your test you should meet with the IA team to discuss the test results. Working with IA will allow you to prioritise work to mitigate test findings and schedule any potential retest of those findings.

## Who you need to contact

To schedule a test please contact [GDS Information Assurance (IA)](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/operations/information-assurance) directly.

For an external penetration test you should provide them with at least three months advance notice due to procurement and third-party supplier lead times.
