At GDS, we follow the the Service Manual guidance on how to monitor the status of services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/monitoring-the-status-of-your-service) and on how to set performance metrics](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/how-to-set-performance-metrics-for-your-service).

For availability monitoring we've successfully used [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/). If you need availability monitoring for a service outside the US or EU, we recommend using [CA App Synthetic Monitor](https://asm.ca.com/en/). 

To further ensure your service is working, you should: 
* run regular [smoke tests](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/deploying-software-regularly#using-smoke-tests-after-you-deploy) using a browser automation app such as [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)
* implement a tool to ensure user journeys are working as you expect
* monitor applications for errors using an error tracking app such as [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)
* implement configuration management to set up repeatable monitoring

Collecting metrics on the performance of your service is useful for [capacity planning](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/test-your-services-performance#start-with-capacity-planning) and autoscaling. You should:

* apply metrics-based monitoring because it's not platform-specific
* create dashboards using [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) to view metrics from your datasource, for example related to your infrastructure or application

Reliability Engineering is running an Alpha on using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) as the operational metrics service for GDS. It will be available to all teams that use the [recommended hosting](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/hosting.html#content) options. Please <a href="mailto:the-gds-way@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk?subject=feedback">contact us</a> to find out more.
