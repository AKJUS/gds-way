When running VMs, such as in Amazon EC2, where the complexity of the configuration
in the instance becomes too great for managing during deployment or within AMIs,
use configuration management.

Using configuration management ensures that the configuration of an environment is
documented as code.

## Tools

In large environments [Puppet][] should be used.

In smaller environments, [Ansible][] is an acceptable choice.
