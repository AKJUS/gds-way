You should use configuration management to track and control changes in large software deployments. When using configuration management you ensure your environment configuration is documented and [stored as code][].

For example, when you run virtual machines (VM) in [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)][] and the VMs instance configuration becomes too complex to manage either during its deployment or within your [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)][] use configuration management.

You should use [Puppet][] in large software environments, and for smaller environments, you can use [Ansible][].

You should not use configuration management for relatively simple deployments as there are other tools more suitable, for example [cloud-init][].
