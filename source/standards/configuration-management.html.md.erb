You should use [configuration management][] to manage, automate and standardise your infrastructure. When using configuration management you store your infrastructure as code, such as your virtual machines (VM) environment configuration.

For example, you can use configuration management during your VMs deployment when running them in [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)][] or in your [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)][]. This ensures build consistency and provide an audit trail of what was changed.

We recommend using [Puppet][] for configuration management, as itâ€™s scalable and widely used. You can find out more about configuration management in the [Service Manual][].
