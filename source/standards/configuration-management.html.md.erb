Use [configuration management][] to manage, automate and standardise your infrastructure. When using configuration management you store your [infrastructure as code][], such as your virtual machines (VM) environment configuration.

A particularly good use case for configuration management is virtual machines, for example, when you run a VM in [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)][] or as an instance in an [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)][].This will help you track and control changes in large software deployments. You will also automatically be building environments consistently - all new environments produced from the same configuration will be identical.

We recommend using [Puppet][] for configuration management, as itâ€™s scalable and widely used.

You can find out more about configuration management in the [Service Manual][].
