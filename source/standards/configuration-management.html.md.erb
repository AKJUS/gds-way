Use [configuration management][] to manage, automate and standardise your infrastructure. When using configuration management you store your [infrastructure as code][] and put that code in a version control system such as Git.

For configuration of servers and virtual machines we recommend the use of [Puppet][] for most systems of even modest complexity, itâ€™s scalable and widely used within GDS. If your environment consists of a simple deployment artefact like an [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)][], Puppet may not be necessary, but the process for building that artefact must be codified and version controlled.

For the configuration of thirty party cloud infrastructure such as AWS or Fastly, use [Terraform][]. It supports a large number of providers, and is configurable to support multiple environments with different parameters. See the [govuk-aws][] repository for an example.

You can find out more about configuration management in the [Service Manual][].
