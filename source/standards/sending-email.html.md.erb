## Sending notifications to users

Use [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) when you need to send notifications to users, for example password resets and confirmation emails.

## Sending notifications to engineers

Use your [alerting], [monitoring] or [logging] tool when sending automatic notifications from systems (for example, cron or jenkins) to engineers.

Only use email notifications from systems when the issue can't be picked up through monitoring or logging.  In these situations, use [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).
