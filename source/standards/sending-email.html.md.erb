GDS uses the following agreed standards for sending email notifications to our service users and engineers.

## How you should send notifications to users

You should use [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) for your GDS service when you need to send notifications to users, for example password resets and confirmation emails.

There's a [complete feature list](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features) available of what you can do with GOV.UK Notify, and you can also register for a [trial account](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/register).

The Service Manual has further information related to [sending emails from your service domain](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/how-to-email-your-users).

## how you should send notifications to engineers

Use your [alerting], [monitoring] or [logging] tool when sending automatic notifications from systems (for example, [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)) to engineers.

You should only use email notifications from systems when the issue can't be picked up through monitoring or logging. In these situations, you should use [Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).
