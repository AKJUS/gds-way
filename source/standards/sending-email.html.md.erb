At GDS you should use the following standards for sending email notifications to service users and engineers.

## How to send notifications to users

Use [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) when sending notifications to users from a GDS service, for example password resets and confirmation emails.

There's a [complete feature list](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features) available of what you can do with GOV.UK Notify, and you can also register for [a Notify account](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/register) here.

The Service Manual has further information related to [sending emails from your service domain](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/how-to-email-your-users).

## How to send notifications to engineers

The [how to manage alerts](alerting.html) page has further information on when and how to send alerts to engineers and other team members.
