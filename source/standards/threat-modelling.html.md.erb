## What's a threat?

To complete threat modelling, you’ll need to know what assets you are trying to protect. It could be a user database, a deployment pipeline or the integrity of web form submissions.

A threat is an action that causes denial, alteration or disclosure of your assets.

## What's threat modelling?

Starts with an [interactive exercise] to surface hypothetical threats or vulnerabilities in a system. [STRIDE] is used to help look at different aspects.

[Scoring] is then done to work out if a threat is valid and prioritise them.

Having identified a valid threat, there are [3 possible responses to threats].

## Why's it necessary?

Information and computer security is typically broken up into 3 main pillars, known as the CIA triad:

### Confidentiality
- Information accessible to authorised people

### Integrity
- Information that's correct

### Availability
- Information available when needed

If one or more of these pillars are abused or neglected, a security incident could occur.

The opposite of the CIA triad is sometimes known as the DAD triad:

- If confidentiality is affected, **d**isclosure occurs.
- If integrity is affected, **a**lteration occurs.
- If availability is affected, **d**enial occurs.

Here is a fun, alternative look at the [CIA and DAD triads, explained with Lord of the Rings references].

## Interactive exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to talk through the architecture or the user journey with people in a session, allowing for questions and answers.

In person, flows are typically drawn up on a whiteboard, followed by questions and post-its of potential threats stuck at relevant points.

Remotely, [Jamboard] can be used to add virtual, potential threats, post-its on-top of a digital diagram.

Use of STRIDE to help question various aspects.

## STRIDE

A model of threats developed by Microsoft. It’s a mnemonic for splitting security threats into 6 categories.

It's a useful tool to think about different potential attacks or vulnerabilities.


|Threat|Security Control|
|-|-|
|**S**poofing|Authenticity|
|**T**ampering|Integrity|
|**R**epudiation|Non-repudiability|
|**I**nformation Disclosure|Confidentiality|
|**D**enial of Service|Availability|
|**E**levation of Privilege|Authorisation|

### Spoofing
Occurs where malicious actors use another person's user credentials without their knowledge.

Also includes attacks where other systems mimic or disguise as others, such as IP address spoofing in DNS amplification attacks.

The desired property is authenticity, meaning an event or action is trustworthy and genuine.

### Tampering
Only authorised users should be able to modify a system or the data it uses.

The desired property is integrity, meaning an event or action is valid and correct.

### Repudiation
The ability to refuse that something is correct.

The desired property is non-repudiation, meaning an action or event is inadmissible by a person or system.

Examples of a non-reputable control is biometric authentication or mutual TLS.

### Information Disclosure
Data is made available to those that shouldn’t have it, such as passwords or personal data of someone else.

The desired property is confidentiality, where data is only available to those who are authorised to view or alter it.

### Denial of Service (DoS)
Data is unavailable for its intended audience.

The desired property is availability, where data is always available when those authorised to view or alter it expect it to be.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a form of DoS where multiple entities are responsible for inappropriate traffic leading to overwhelmed services.

### Elevation of Privilege
Data is available to unintended or unauthenticated users.

The desired property is authorisation, where data is only available when those expected to be able view or alter it.

## Scoring

Once threats are discovered, there is Google Sheet template you can copy to use for noting down a threat, the most likely actor, scoring, and tracking mitigation.

The template sheet with notes is here:
[[PROGRAMME - PRODUCT] Threat Modelling Scoring [template]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u22W_bUEPESvbMde-Q4syJLTen1OKIcE4ILk7wyaydM/edit#gid=0)

Scoring is useful to prioritise what's valid and what should be looked into first.

Difficulty is a rating between 0 (very easy) to 5 (hard), it should take into account how hard it would be to gain access and any costs associated to perform the attack.

Reward is a rating between 0 (low) to 5 (high), it's how valuable the outcome is to the threat actor.

The final score equals reward minus difficulty, so a high score is worse than a low one.

## Response to threats

There are 3 main responses that GDS uses against threats:

### Mitigate
Implement a preventive control, such as an architectural change, to eliminate the vulnerability or block the threat.

### Monitor
A reactive control to detect if a threat occurs, this is about controlling a situation and limiting damage or loss by finding out about an attack early.

### Acknowledge the risk
Acknowledging the risk, but not planning any action, can help with resourcing any future mitigation or deciding to accept a risk as the cost of the mitigation outweighs the maximum cost of a threat.
