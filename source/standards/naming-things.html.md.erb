Read this guide when you need to name things for your software project, for example applications, software libraries, plugins or frameworks. Your users should understand what something does from its name.

## Your name should be self-descriptive

Avoid naming things using puns or branding, as this makes it difficult for others to understand what the thing does.

Ensure you use the same name consistently whenever you’re referring to the same thing. For example in most cases the name of an application’s GitHub repository, for example [alphagov/signon](
https://github.com/alphagov/signon) should match its application name.

These software project names clearly communicate their purpose:

- [Signon](https://signon.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in) (which used to be called signonontron2000)
- [Manuals Publisher](https://github.com/alphagov/manuals-publisher)
- [Smart Answers](https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers)
- [Digital Marketplace Admin Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-admin-frontend)
- [Notifications PaaS Autoscaler](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-paas-autoscaler)

The names of these software projects are ambiguous and possibly confusing:

- [Panopticon](https://github.com/gds-attic/panopticon)
- [Whitehall](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall)
- [Rummager](https://github.com/alphagov/rummager)
- [Maslow](https://github.com/alphagov/maslow)
- Magna Charta

services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service), much
of which will also be relevant when naming applications or packages.
