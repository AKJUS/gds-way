To make your services available over the internet you will need DNS records to let people know where those services are. Services on GOV.UK domains (for example, service.gov.uk) are delegated to nameservers controlled by service teams.

The Service Manual has further information related to [choosing where to host your DNS](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name#choose-where-youll-host-your-dns).

As part of your DNS strategy and planning we recommend that:

- your DNS entry configuration should come from a version-controlled repository (for example GitHub) unless autogenerated
- you consider nameserver availability as part of your overall service availability

You should consider what tools you need to implement your DNS strategy, you can:

- use [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) as a cloud DNS web service
- use [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/) or [Dyn](https://dyn.com) if you want more availability for your nameservers
- use a tool to version control and publish your records if necessary, for example [GOV.UK DNS](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-dns) or [octoDNS](https://github.com/github/octodns)
