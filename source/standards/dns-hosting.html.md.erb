You need accurate DNS records to ensure your service is available to your users. For example, services on GOV.UK domains are delegated to [nameservers](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name#check-where-youll-host-your-dns) controlled by GDS service teams.

As part of your DNS strategy and planning we recommend your:

* DNS entry configuration comes from a version-controlled repository such as GitHub, unless autogenerated
* overall service strategy includes nameserver availability

When you implement your DNS strategy you should use:

* [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) as a cloud DNS web service
* [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/) or [Dyn](https://dyn.com) if you want greater nameserver availability
* a tool to version control and publish your records, for example [GOV.UK DNS](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-dns) or [octoDNS](https://github.com/github/octodns)

The Service Manual has further information related to [choosing where to host your DNS](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name#choose-where-youll-host-your-dns).
