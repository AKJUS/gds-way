To ensure users can connect to your service, you’ll need accurate Domain Name System (DNS) records and a DNS provider to supply your DNS nameservers.

You can find information on choosing where to host your DNS and how to request nameserver delegation at GDS in the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name#choose-where-youll-host-your-dns).

As part of your DNS strategy and planning your:
* DNS entry configuration (stored for example in a zone file using JSON or YAML) should be version controlled unless it’s autogenerated
* overall service strategy includes namesever high availability, for example signon.publishing.service.gov.uk is deployed to both Amazon Route 53 and Google Cloud DNS

When you implement your DNS strategy you should consider using:

* [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) as a cloud DNS web service
* [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/) or [Dyn](https://dyn.com) for high nameserver availability
* version control to publish your records using tools such as [GOV.UK DNS](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-dns) or [octoDNS](https://github.com/github/octodns)

The Service Manual has further information on [choosing where to host your DNS](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name).
