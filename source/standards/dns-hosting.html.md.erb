To ensure users can connect to your service, you'll need accurate Domain Name System (DNS) records and a DNS provider to supply your DNS nameservers.

You can find information on choosing where to host your DNS and how to request nameserver delegation at GDS in the [Service Manual][].

As part of your DNS strategy and planning you need to ensure:

* your DNS record configuration is reproducible (for example, the DNS records are version controlled or autogenerated)
* you consider DNS availability as part of overall service availability.

For example, `publishing.service.gov.uk` is published to both Amazon Route 53 and Google Cloud DNS to remove vendor as a single point of failure.
This means that even if AWS has a total outage, users can access parts of GOV.UK by using Google Cloud DNS to resolve addresses, and viewing content that is available in the CDN cache.

Note that if your service availability relies on a single vendor, there is less benefit to deploying DNS to multiple vendors.

When you implement your DNS strategy you should consider using:

* [Amazon Route 53][] as a cloud DNS web service
* [Google Cloud DNS][] for high nameserver availability

You can read more about [service domains and DNS][] in the Service Manual.

## Production and non-production domain names

Your non-production domains should be subdomains of your production domain.

For example, if you service can be found at `myservice.service.gov.uk`, then you might also have Route 53 records for your other environments, such as:

* `staging.myservice.service.gov.uk`
* `dev.myservice.service.gov.uk`

You can manage all of these records from your production Route 53 configuration pipeline, even though they relate to other environments.

If your service has more complex needs you may alternatively
[delegate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-routing-traffic-for-subdomains.html)
the zone for a subdomain to an AWS account that relates specifically to that environment.

## Internal GDS services

Internal GDS services must be hosted on subdomains of the `digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` domain.

> [!TIP]
> This domain is likely to change as part of GDS moving to DSIT.

Once you have
[configured your Route 53 hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingNewSubdomain.html),
you'll need to use the
[GDS IT Help Desk](https://gdshelpdesk.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/helpdesk)
to request delegation of your subdomain - choose:

* IT Requests
* Changes - Request & Support
* DNS
