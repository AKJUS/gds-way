Reliability Engineering provide a shared platform to GDS teams. They help teams run services by:

* procuring tools such as Logit and, where appropriate, administering them for GDS;
* running off-the-shelf services for GDS as internal SaaS such as Prometheus;
* providing patterns and guidance like the PaaS incident templates.

For more information on the services and how to access them, see the [Reliability Engineering documentation](https://reliability-engineering.cloudapps.digital/).
